## Introduction

Hetu is a lightweight script language purely written in Dart for embedding in Flutter apps. The main goal is to enable Flutter apps to have hotfix and scripting ability.

We did not choose to use another existing language to achieve the goal. Because we want to keep the language simple, and keep it away from interference of other language's complex implementation and their irrelative-to-Flutter eco-system, and make the debug process pain-free and remain in Dart realms.

It takes very little time to bind almost anything in Dart/Flutter into Hetu, makes communicating with your existing Dart code very easy.

##Installation

For pure dart project, add 'hetu_script: 0.3.0+1' (or future higher versions) in your pubspec.yaml.

```yaml
dependencies:
  hetu_script: ^0.3.0+1
```

- For handling module import from physical disk within the script, and REPL tool, there's another package called: 'hetu_script_dev_tools'.
- For Flutter project, use package 'hetu_script_flutter' along with 'hetu_script', then you can easily read script from assets. Note that in Flutter, the [init] method is changed:

```dart
import 'package:hetu_script/hetu_script.dart';
import 'package:hetu_script_flutter/hetu_script_flutter.dart';

final hetu = Hetu();
await hetu.initFlutter();
// do something
```

## Quick start

Hetu's grammar is close to typescript/kotlin/swift and other modern languages, need very little time to get familar with.

- Optional semicolon.
- Function is declared with 'fun, get, set, construct'.
- Optional type annotation. Variable declared will infer its type from its initializer expression.

[Syntax referrence](https://github.com/hetu-script/hetu-script/blob/master/docs/docs/en-US/syntax/index.md)

This is an example to eval a string literal of Hetu code in Dart.

```dart
import 'package:hetu_script/hetu_script.dart';

void main() {
  var hetu = Hetu();
  hetu.init();
  hetu.eval(r'''
    fun main {
      var ht = {
        name: 'Jimmy',
        greeting: () {
          print('Hi! I\'m', this.name)
        }
      }
      ht.greeting()
    }
  ''', invokeFunc: 'main');
}
```

## Binding

Hetu script is purely written in Dart, so passing object to and from script is extremely easy.

Check [this page](https://github.com/hetu-script/hetu-script/blob/master/docs/docs/en-US/binding/index.md) for more information about how to bind external classes, functions, enums and how to passing object and functions between Dart and script.

```dart
import 'package:hetu_script/hetu_script.dart';

void main() {
  var hetu = Hetu();
  hetu.init(externalFunctions: {
    'hello': () => {'greeting': 'hello'},
  });
  hetu.eval(r'''
      external fun hello
      fun main {
        var dartValue = hello()
        print('dart value:', dartValue)
        dartValue['foo'] = 'bar'
        return dartValue
      }''');

  var hetuValue = hetu.invoke('main');

  print('hetu value: $hetuValue');
}
```
