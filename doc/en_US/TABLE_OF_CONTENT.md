# Hetu Script

Hetu is a lightweight script language written purely in Dart. It is intended to be embedded in Flutter/Dart apps & games to enable hotfixes and scripting.

Hetu's grammar is close to typescript/kotlin/swift and other modern languages, hence need very little time to get familar with.

It meant to be used as a scripting language like lua, however, it is made to communicate with classes & functions in Dart very easily.
