# Namespace

You can create a code block within a source or a function body, by declaring with keyword **namespace** and an Identifer as its name.

The namespace code block works like a class definition. It only allows for variable/class/function declaration, but not for expresssions.

```c++
namespace universe {
  var meaning = 42
}

print(universe.meaning)
```

Refer [Do statement](../control_flow/readme.md#do) for another kind of code block.
